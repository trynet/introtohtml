        <p>At last we get to the heart of what hypermedia is about - the ability 
          to jump from file to file, or document to document, if you prefer.</p>
         
<p>I'm talking about links. With Lesson 5, you will learn how to create links
   between pages, how to make targeted links, how to create external page links
   (to other web sites) and how to make mailto links.</p>
        
<p>Lab 5 - First Site has you linking all five pages together plus a few other
  tricks.</p>
<p>Make sure to read <a href="../appendix/D.html">Appendix D - Files And Folders
    - What's In A Name</a>? which
  is about as important an idea as anything you'll learn in our class. To make
  web pages and sites, you have to understand how to use and refer to URLs, Path
    Statements, Locations, Addresses. It's really all the same--it's where a
    file is located and how you refer to it.</p>
        
<p>If you don't get what Appendix C is about,  let me know. If you don't
  understand files and folders, then making sites isn't just going to be difficult
  - it's going to be impossible.</p>
        
<p>Speaking of site making, the subject inevitably gets to the question: &quot;How
   do I transfer my files to a web server so everyone can see what I'm doing?&quot; 
  That's what <a href="../appendix/E.html">Appendix E - FTP Or How To Get Your Files From Here To There</a> is
   about.</p>

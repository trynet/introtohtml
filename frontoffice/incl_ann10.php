        <p>I like to think of the last lesson in our class as the dessert to a really good
  meal. But you don't get to eat the dessert as I am going to give you a look
  at what Cascading Style Sheets does. I take our five perfectly valid and well
  formed .html files and dress them all up
  using CSS. </p>
<p>CSS is the language which brings layout,white space, typography and color
  to our web pages. Not only is it's purpose completely different than HTML so
  to is it's syntax as you are about to see.</p>


<h3>This Is The End - Or Is It?</h3>

<p>So this is it? Has our time of learning together  come to an end? </p>
<p>Only if you want it to. You should know that the follow up class  to this
   one is 
 <a href="learning_css.html"> Joy Of Code: Practical CSS</a>. If you have gotten
 to this point, you are ready to learn how to style web pages - especially after
 you've seen a little of what I can do in the last Lesson. Now
  that's when you really get into web page design. If you are going to work with
  Content Management Systems like WordPress then learning CSS is a must!!</p>
<p>I sincerely
  hope that Joy Of Code:  Intro To HTML was everything you wished for and more.</p>
<p> I have a few things I want to say as you leave so make sure to see
  <a href="../appendix/G.html">Appendix  G - Takeaways</a>. I lift up the curtain
  so you can go behind the scenes to see a little bit about how I made this class.</p>
<p>If you liked what you saw and did, please tell your friends and colleagues.
  No sense in keeping it quiet. Anyone can enroll and start any of my classes
  at at any time. Your referrals are eagerly accepted and appreciated.  </p>
<p>So now it's Au Revoir, Auf Wiedersehen, Adios, Shalom, Ciao and Good-bye.</p>

<p>But do stay in touch with Your Friendly Web Design Instructor!!</p>

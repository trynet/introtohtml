<p>Our focus in Chapter 3 is on Lists - Unordered, Ordered and Definition Lists.
   And most important - the concept of nesting. Hopefully, you will have the
  Urge  To Nest from time to time, or rather, you will learn nesting and when
  to use  it. Nesting is something that helps define content which is what HTML
   is all about.
</p>
<p>Lab 3 - First Lists directs you to add lists to some of the files you made
  in Lab 2. You still have those around don't you? I told you to save them -
  as you should for everything you make as each Lab builds upon what you did
in previous Labs.</p>
<p>You can practice Lists either with the Code Tester or by making a new file.
  If you do it the latter way, make sure to include in your file the DOCTYPE
Statement and the required tags you learned in Lesson 1. </p>
<p>This Lab gives you the chance to see how you are doing without my instructions. Take
  advantage of the Extra Credit and I will look at how you are doing with your
  own lists.  </p>

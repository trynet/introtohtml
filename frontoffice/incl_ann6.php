        <p>Can you stand a little beauty?</p>  
<p>We are, at last, ready to meet up with graphical images, or more specifically, 
  how to embed images into our web pages. Our focus is not upon the production 
  and design of images for the web - that's a whole 'nother big topic for which 
  other resources are available.</p>
        
<p>We'll learn which image formats are supported by browsers, and some of the 
  distinguishing characteristics which differentiate these image formats. </p>
        <p>In the process, we will work with the img element and the alt attribute.
           I'll show you how to create clickable images too.</p>
<p>At the end I'll show you how to insert videos into your web pages.</p>
        
<p>In Lab 6 - First Embeds, you'll be transforming your five .html files to
  accept  embedded images. You can download all the images you will need for
  this Lab right from the Lab itself. I've also put all the images in your work
  space to save you from having to do it yourself.</p>
<p>Images are normally kept in a sub-folder relative to your .html files. You'll
   see more about that when you read through Lesson 6 - Images And Videos , and
  when you do the Lab and post your work to Work Space.</p>

<h1>FAQ</h1>
<p>Here are a few things that I haven't adequately addressed anywhere
      else in my Front Office.</p>
<p class="faqquestion">Does it matter what browser I use? What about
    my operating system? Does that matter? And what are you using, Friendly Web
    Design Instructor</p>
<p>Since this class is HTML only, how pages look in a browser is <strong>irrelevant</strong>
   (but it sure does matter if you go on to learn CSS).</p>
<p>Having said that IE 8 on Windows
  XP does not understand the tags that are new to HTML5. Many of those tags
  are explored in Lesson 9 - First Grouping. So that browser will cause a problem
  with viewing this class material but it won't cause you a problem as far as
  your work in the Labs is concerned. (Newer versions of IE on all Windows versions should be just fine).</p>
<p>Bottom  line. All current browsers will have no problem with either the class
  material or the practice you'll be doing in each Lab.</p>
<p>As for the operating system, it doesn't matter.</p>
<p class="faqquestion"><strong>What's The Code Tester?</strong></p>
<p>This is a handy little thing I invented to give you a chance to quickly try
  out your HTML code. You'll find the Code Tester scattered about the Workshop
  when I think it might be a good idea to try something out. </p>
<p>See for yourself. <img src="../images/code_tester_icon.gif" alt="Code Tester Icon" width="40" height="33" /> <a href="../code_tester.html">Code
    Tester</a>.</p>
<p>While lots of students have enJoyed this nifty utility don't fall in love
  with it.</p>
<p class="faqquestion"><strong>Speaking of code, how can I see the code of a
    page you did for this class? </strong></p>
<p>Knowing how to do this is very important. I have two videos in <a href="../lab1.html#vid">Lab
    1</a> that will show you how.</p>
<p>I highly recommend that you get into the habit of looking at the source code
  of pages. You may not understand everything you see, but over time you will
  see patterns, and it's a great way to learn. </p>
<p>In fact, it's the way I learned HTML in 1996.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a difference between XHTML and HTML?</strong></p>
<p>Technically there is but from an everyday point of view, not really. I go
  over some of this in Lesson 1 - The Basics. You may know HTML or XHTML already
  but you may not know it well or what you know is outdated. Stick with me and
  we will change all of that.</p>
<p class="faqquestion"><strong>What if I get really frustrated with something?
  I've read all the material and followed the Lab directions, but something
  is not going right.</strong></p>
<p>The best thing to do in such situations - after you've torn your hair out
  in clumps - is to stop what you're doing. Get up from your chair. Take some
  deep cleansing breaths. Then go make dinner and go out to a movie. </p>
<p>In other words, get your mind off of it. Chances are the solution will come
  as your brain does some background processing!!</p>
<p><strong>Where are the images? How come I don't see lots of graphics here?</strong></p>
<p>You will see images in the pages you make for this class once we get to Lab
   6.</p>
<p>This class  focuses on the use - embedding - of images in your pages. If you're
  not a graphic artist, no sweat. All the images you need are included inside
  this class in Lab 6. And to save you time you'll find
  all these images already uploaded to your Work Space.</p>
<p class="faqquestion"><strong>Is there a text book for the class?</strong> </p>
<p>No because everything you need is already here.</p>
<p>The books I have read and recommend are available through my bookstore, in
  association with amazon.com. Go ahead and <a href="bookstore.html">browse down
  the aisle</a>. And pick something out while you're there!!</p>
<p><strong>In the class you suggest copying and pasting from time to time.
    Any drawbacks to that?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. As you will see, when you do the Labs, you will have the opportunity
  to grossly copy and paste my material - but if you do, you are wasting your
  time and money.</p>
<p>So don't do it unless I say so. And that is an order!!</p>
<p class="faqquestion"><strong>What about printing? May I print a page so that
    it's easy to read?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, but you are bound by the <a href="tos.html">Terms Of Service</a>. You
  may only make one copy for your personal use and that copy is not to be transmitted
  in any way to anyone else. The TOS stipulates that you have a restricted license
  to use this class and that you do not own any of the material herein (as they
  say).</p>

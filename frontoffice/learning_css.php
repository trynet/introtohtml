<p>Once you are finished with this class you'll be a little like this picture.
   Like   Ginger and Fred, the iPod and Head Phones or Lennon and McCartney
  HTML and CSS go together.
  When it comes to web design HTML needs CSS and so do you!!</p>

<h2>How The Class Works - And The Fees</h2>



<p>Each  lesson has several exercises which emphasize the material presented
  in that lesson.</p>

<p>There is a $100 fee for access to the material with no time limit.  You'd
  work on the exercises independent of me. However, when you need me to go through
  the material and answer questions, you can set up a webinar session. ( I feel
  3 - 5 hours of webinar time would allow me to hit the highlights and make sure
  you understand the material.) There is a fee of $65 per webinar session  
  that would run about one hour. How many of these webinar sessions you will
  need would be up to you, but there is a <strong>mandatory</strong> one hour session. </p>
<p><strong>MORE GOOD NEWS!! </strong>After your initial one hour webinar I 
  discount the $65 one hour webinar fee to $50 per hour when you purchase more
  than
  a one hour webinar. That means you'll pay $100 for two more hours rather than
  $130. You like that, don't ya!!</p>
  
<p><strong>Add the access fee of $100 to the mandatory one
  hour webinar fee of $65, and you can learn CSS for $165</strong>.</p>

<p>The fees are payable through PayPal. You can also use any credit card with
  their system without having a  PayPal account. Pay now and I'll send you the
  &quot;Getting Started&quot; directions.</p>



<p>The material I use is in development for an online class I am calling Joy
  Of Code: Practical CSS that will be all self-taught. It's just not ready for
  prime time yet and I am keeping my prices down below to where they will be
  once the service is launched.</p>

<p>I use GoToMeeting   webinar technology where you  see my desktop
  and I can see yours as well. It's really ideal for what we want to accomplish.
  GoToMeeting is very easy to use. A webinar hour can be scheduled at a time
  that works best for you - many nights and weekends are available.</p>

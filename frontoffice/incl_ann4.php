 <p>It's only Lesson 4 but we have already reached the most important principle of this class. You are going to learn how to error check and correct your own pages.  By doing
  so, you won't need me to do the kind of reviews I've done for your pages
  in the previous labs.</p>
<p>Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere, but it's time for you to learn what I
  know and how to accelerate what you are learning.</p>
<p> Validation is testing your HTML files to make sure they meet W3C published
   specifications. Our focus will be using the W3C Validation Service to test
  the  files you have uploaded to your Work Space.</p>
<p>I'll also introduce you to other validation services, all of which will assist
   you in using the  best ways to work with your content.</p>

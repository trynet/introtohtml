<p>Lesson 2 - Fundamental Elements is now available as well as Lab 2 - First Tags. Read
   and do everything. </p>
<p>If you get antsy, and are in an experimentation mode, use the Code Tester
  to  try things out. I find it handy in sampling code snippets. The Code Tester
  is  not going to be making pages and sites (that's what you're going to be
  doing),  but it will give you a feeling for how HTML works.</p>
<p>You are going to meet up with some of the building blocks of web pages such
  as the  elements that allow you to to define headings and paragraphs.</p>

<p>When you're done with the lab, post your file to the Work Space as you did
  before.

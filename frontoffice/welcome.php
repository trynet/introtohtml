<p>Why am I working so hard here?  You are going to have to do the labs to find out.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, my wife Arlene told me to get rid of this rather shabby photo but you can see I haven't listened to her - yet.</p>

<p>My name is Bud Kraus, Your Friendly Web Design Instructor. One of the things
  I love most about Intro To HTML is that it gives me the opportunity to teach
  you  skills that will last a life time.</p>
<p >You are embarking on a journey whose destination is magical as you are about
  to learn some of the most important skills in the world today. Skills that
  you, employers and clients need!!</p>
<p>That's right. You're about to learn  Hyper Text Markup Language
  (HTML), the lingua franca of the world wide web. At the end you will get a
  look at how  Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used for page layout, typography
  and color. CSS needs its own class and that's why I'm creating the follow up
  course to this one, <a href="learning_css.html">Joy Of Code: Practical CSS</a>.</p>
<p>What you will do with what you learn here is probably beyond your comprehension.
  I am amazed at how I've used HTML in different ways over the years.</p>
<p >My job is to teach you fundamental skills and concepts. Your job - such as
  it is - is to learn a right way and wrong way to markup (format) the content
  of web ages. You are going to learn and do HTML the right way because there
  is only an upside and no downside for doing it the right way.</p>
<p >Just make sure to  read all Lessons  and do the Labs that will be presented
  during the class and to have fun too.</p>
<p >And be  sure to see your <a href="schedule.html">Schedule</a> for this class
  and to read through everything in my Front Office (which is where you are now).</p>

<h2>Before Our Journey Begins Take The Following With You</h2>
<ol>
  <li> A good understanding of how to save, open, find, rename and delete folders
    and files. 
  </li>
  <li>Familiarity with a web browser. Mozilla Firefox ) is my
    browser of choice, but you are free to use any other browser such as Internet
    Explorer, Opera, or Safari. It is strongly recommended that you use the
    most current version of any of these browsers.
  </li>
  <li>A basic text editor such as Notepad or TextEdit. Do not use big Word processors
    like Word.</li>
      <li>How to multi-task (switch back and forth) between applications. Making
    .html files requires going back and forth between your browser and an above
    mentioned text editor. I will help you with this in Lab 1, when we get there,
    if you've never done this before.
  </li>
</ol>


<hr />


<p>Your first assignment is to read through everything in the Front Office. Then
  you'll be ready for Lesson 1 - The Basics which you can access through the
  Home Room. </p>
<p>So sit back, relax and enjoy. If all goes well, you're going to learn a lot
  and have some fun in the process. If you have any question about anything,
  ask! No sense getting needlessly frustrated about anything. My email address
  is at the bottom of every page.</p>

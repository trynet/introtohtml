<p>Using HTML elements to group your content to give it real meaning is as an important concept as any that I can teach you.  </p>

<p>In Lesson 9 - Grouping Elements you will use new HTML5 tags to define parts
  of your pages that are headers, footers, sections, articles, asides and navigation
  interfaces. I'll also show you tags that do a great job in helping to define
  form and data table content.</p>

<p>As you add those elements to your pages in the Lab, please take note of the HTML outlines I did for all five pages.  There you will see the sequencing of the tags which is most important for learning how to create a well formed document and for working effectively with CSS.</p>
<p>As always, when you are done with the lab you should have five valid .html
  files and if you do you have done a great job!! You are ready for the fun
  and pretty stuff - CSS!! </p>

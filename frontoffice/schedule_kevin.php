<h1>Schedule</h1>

<p>Here's how everything works.</p>
        <p>Each week you will cover a new lesson and Lab which is the hands-on
          part of our class, As you'll soon find out, the current subject
          builds upon what you will have already learned. So stay with it, do
          your reading and lab work, and you'll be on your way to becoming a
        Jedi Web Designer.</p>
        <p>We'll take it nice and easy in Lesson 1 - The Basics as we get
          acquainted  with Joy Of Code: Intro To HTML and each other. </p>

      <!--#include virtual="../cgi-bin/ws1_incl_schedule.pl" -->
      
      <p>As time passes the classes Lessons and Labs will be available from
           the Home Room which is the first page you'll see upon entrance (after
           typing in your username and password). That's why only Lesson One
          is  available at the start. Lesson Two's link - which deals with The
        Fundamental Elements - is activated at the start of the second week.
        And so on, until all 10 Lessons are rolled out. Makes sense, right?        </p>
      <p>I always leave Lessons and Labs up that you've already read and done
           so you can refer to them as we move on. You'll find it easy to jump
           from Lesson to Lesson when you are in the Home Room. Since everything
          is always left up, don't worry if you miss something - but don't fall
          behind. I admit that Lesson One is light because I want you to read
          and explore the course interface. As we move on, you will find that
          things will take a bit longer to master, but that's the price you pay
          for having fun!!</p  >
        <p>The class consists of <strong>10  Lessons </strong> which are 
           rolled out one week at a time. </p>

        Your Schedule</a>?</p>
<p>It also consists of <strong>9  Labs</strong> which corresponds with
              the first 9 Lessons. Each Lab exercises the information of the associated
              Lesson. You are to post all of your Lab work inside your Work Space
              so I can review what you are doing. You should get my Review by email
              within 48 hours of your posting, but frequently sooner than that.
              I  don't want to keep you waiting!!        </p>
            <p>If, for any reason, you need more than 10 weeks to complete the class
              I've got some rules about <a href="overtime.html">Overtime</a>.</p>

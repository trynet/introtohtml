<h1>Overtime</h1>
<p>This class was designed to be completed in 10 weeks. Experience has shown
  not everyone can do that.</p>
<p>Family emergencies, business trips, vacations, holidays, and the occasional
  need to mysteriously disappear for a while cause some people to need more
  than 12 weeks to complete the class. </p>
<h2>Here Are Your Options If You Need More Time</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>If you can't finish in the 10 weeks, I am giving you two extra weeks to
      wrap up Joy. I still highly recommend that you complete the workshop within
      12 weeks if at all possible. That's the best approach.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If 12 weeks does not do it, you may continue for another two weeks for
      an additional charge of $50. That will give you 14 weeks to get all
      the Joy you could possibly need or want. Plus, you get to stick around
      with me a while longer and that's not bad!!</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>If You Have Changed Your Schedule</h2>
<p>The above policy still applies if you have exercised your option to <a href="change_schedule.html">change
    your schedule</a> and shorten the time you have to do Joy Of Code: Intro
    To HTML. </p>
<p>For example, if your scheduled last day of the workshop is January 1, you'll
  still have two free extra weeks - until January 15 - to wrap up the workshop.
  If you need additional time - another two weeks - you will be charged $50 and
  have until January 30 to finish up.</p>
<h2>What If You Need More Than 14 Weeks?</h2>
<p>If more than 14 weeks are needed, then we  lawyer up and negotiate!!</p>

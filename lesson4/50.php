<h1>Other Validation Tools</h1>     


   <p>Validating HTML files is but one type of file checking you need to    
     be aware of. For example, W3C has a different validator that checks 
     CSS errors.</p>        <p>I recommend bookmarking these and any other validation
       tools that you'll come across in this class. Keep in mind that some,
       like Vischeck, are not rock solid because they continue to be under development. </p>        <p>That's something to remember about many validators, come to think of           it.</p>

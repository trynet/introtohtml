<h1 class="page-header">Lesson 4: Validation</h1>

 <p class="introduction lead">It's only Lesson 4 but we have already reached one of the most important concepts  of this class. You are going to learn how to error check and correct your own pages.  By doing
  so, you won't need me to do the kind of reviews I've done for your pages
  in the previous labs.</p>
 <P>How so?</p>
<P>You are going to learn how to error check the code you have written to this
  point.  It will be something I will expect you to do for all the lessons
  which follow.</p>
<P>Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere, but it's time for you to learn what I
  know and how to accelerate what you are learning.</p>
<P>HTML validation is an error checking process. It's a lot like spell and grammar
  checking but this time it's abut checking to see that the sequence of the tags
  on your html files is correct.</p>
<p>A frequent misunderstanding among people learning how to make web pages           is that &quot;if it looks okay on my computer, everything must be good.&quot;           It's even, surprisingly, a misconception among those who should know           better.</p>
<p>But  you do know better. HTML's sole purpose is about the structure of your
  web document. It organizes content, through the use of the tags, so that it
  has meaning. It has nothing to do with how a web page looks. That's a job
  totally left to Cascading Style Sheets.</p>
<p>Little secret. I have not been looking at your pages in the browser. All I have done so far - and will continue to do - is error check your code. No reason for me to look at how your page looks in the browser. Again, that's the job of Cascading Style Sheets which you can learn with me but let's stay on topic here, shall we?</p>     

   <p>No matter what you are validating - HTML , CSS or something else -    
      the process is roughly the same. You'll be sending a page to a server via
     file upload or URL. That server will analyze your file and provide you with
     the results of the validation.</p>    
     
     <p> Validation is testing your HTML files to make sure they meet W3C published
   specifications. Our focus will be using the W3C Validation Service to test
  the  files you have uploaded to your Work Space.</p>  
   
     
<p>If you're a programmer, validation is akin to debugging, in that it      
   tells you if your code is not up to snuff and what needs to be changed. 
  Yes, it is a little geeky at first but you will get used to it. once you get
  good at writing HTML you'll hardly be using the validator because you won't
  need
  to. You'll know how to write perfectly valid HTML and you'll be glad you do!!</p>
<p id="learn">In this lesson you'll learn:</p>
<ul class="nav">            <li><i class="icon-ok PadRight5"></i>Why Validate?</li>           
                 <li><i class="icon-ok PadRight5"></i>File Requirements 
			  </li>               
			  <li><i class="icon-ok PadRight5"></i>W3C Validation</li>       
				 <li><i class="icon-ok PadRight5"></i>Other Validation Tools</li>         
</ul>         

<p>Get into the good habit of using validation tools when you develop           and produce web pages. As you'll see, a &quot;Joy Of Code&quot; lies           in a successful validation!!</p>

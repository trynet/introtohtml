<p class="introduction lead">The key to making well-formed documents (web pages that
  validate

  to industry standards and give meaning to content) is through the proper use of HTML.
</p>

        <p>Why is creating well-formed documents important, you ask? </p>

        <p>For starters, it's the way to get web documents to have integrity
          and hold 

          up in legacy, as well as new, technologies. Why create pages which
          

          are obsolete at launch or soon thereafter? Why create sites which are
          

  going to be a  content management nightmare? </p>
        <p>Writing good HTML will help big time with the following:</p>
        <ul class="nav">
          <li><i class="icon-thumbs-up PadRight5"></i>How  Google and other search engines understand your web site making
            it easier to get found.</li>
          <li><i class="icon-thumbs-up PadRight5"></i>How CSS will work when you learn how to style pages.</li>
          <li><i class="icon-thumbs-up PadRight5"></i>How people will understand the content of your pages.</li>
          <li><i class="icon-thumbs-up PadRight5"></i>How assistive technologies will work for people with disabilities.</li>
        </ul>
<p>I want you not just to learn what HTML tags do, but to get in your 

          mind that they are not to be used for style or presentational purposes.

          For example, you'll see that the heading tags present font with different

          sizing, but that is not the reason why heading tags are used.</p>

        
<p>You know about the tags that are required in all HTML documents. (What, 

          you forgot Lesson 1 already?) This Lesson, and the ones that follow,
  

          detail tags which fall between the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> 

          container.</p>
          
          <p>You are going to meet up with some of the building blocks of web pages such
  as the  elements that allow you  to define headings and paragraphs.</p>
  
<p id="learn">In this Lesson you'll learn about:</p>


<ul class="nav">
     <li><i class="icon-ok PadRight5"></i>The First Tags - <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;hr /&gt;</code></li>
     <li><i class="icon-ok PadRight5"></i>Heading Tags</li>
     <li><i class="icon-ok PadRight5"></i>The Quote Tag</li>
     <li><i class="icon-ok PadRight5"></i>Strong And Emphasis Tags</li>
     <li><i class="icon-ok PadRight5"></i>Display: Block-level And inline</li>
     <li><i class="icon-ok PadRight5"></i>White Space And Matters Of Style</li>
     <li><i class="icon-ok PadRight5"></i>Character Entities (I love these little babies)</li>
     <li><i class="icon-ok PadRight5"></i>The Comment Tag</li>
</ul>

<p>If you get antsy, and are in an experimentation mode, use the <a href="../code_tester.html">Code Tester</a>
  to  try things out. I find it handy in sampling code snippets. The Code Tester
  is  not going to be making pages and sites (that's what you're going to be
  doing),  but it will give you a feeling for how HTML works.</p>
  
<p>As with all Lessons, there's a Lesson 2 Lab. It's called &quot;First Tags.&quot; If
  you've done the Ice Breaker &quot;Hello World&quot; Lab, you have the gist
  as to how Labs work. But this Lab is a tad more involved. </p>

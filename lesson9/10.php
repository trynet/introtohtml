 <h1>Lesson 9: Grouping Elements</h1>

<p class="introduction">Truth be told you've been using HTML elements to group content all along. While this lesson will show you many new grouping elements, the idea should be nothing new to you.</p>

<p>Grouping is what fortifies the structure of your web docs. You saw a little
  of that in the last lesson when I showed you thead, tbody and tfoot. You've
  also seen it in  list markup as the ul and ol elements were used to group
  list items. While you don't necessarily need to group elements like what you
  will see here, I strongly urge that you do so. It's one of the things that separates people who know HTML from those that don't.</p>

<p>So here's another truth to tell. So far as I recall, if you look at the specs
  on HTML (or XHTML) there is no technical thing as &quot;grouping&quot;. However,
  I do recall that the best practices in using markup is to use HTML to define
  content by grouping. It makes so much sense to me.</p>
<p>Besides, you will be richly rewarded by using these grouping elements when
  you go on to learn Cascading Style Sheets. I'll get into that story when you
  go on to learn CSS.</p>

<p>Many of these elements in this lesson are new to HTML and are part of the
  HTML5 specs. If you are familiar with the div tag - which has done the heavy
  lifting of grouping HTML elements for years - you'll see the reduced role div
  will play in the future. And that's a good thing!!</p>

<p id="learn">In this lesson we'll go over:</p>

<H1 class="page-header">Lesson 3: Lists</h1>



<p class="introduction lead">List markup is a  tried and true way of presenting

    structured information to a web visitor.</p>



        <p>Why? Lists are an excellent way to organize content into a hierarchy. It's
         a great builder of page structure.</p>
        <p>It's been proven that people scan web content rather than read

          it, and lists are the way to catch a reader's eye. Lists are also used
          to create navigation interfaces. (That's the fancy way of saying that web page
          navigation is a list of links).</p>



<p>There are three types of lists -- Unordered, Ordered and

Definition Lists. The first two are used to present bulleted and

numbered lists, respectively. A Definition List is used for

glossaries and dictionaries - that kind of thing.</p>



<p>The last part of this lesson introduces the powerful idea of

nesting, the ability to place an HTML element (like a list) within

itself, much like the child's toy where a small box fits inside a

bigger box, which in turn can be placed inside yet a bigger box.</p>



        
<p>Learning how to nest elements  - such as a list - is an important part of
how HTML works and how to create great page structure.</p>
		
		<p id="learn">In this lesson you'll learn about:</p>
        
        
<ul class="nav">
     
<li><i class="icon-ok PadRight5"></i>Unordered Lists</li>
     
<li><i class="icon-ok PadRight5"></i>Ordered Lists</li>

<li><i class="icon-ok PadRight5"></i>Definition Lists</li>
     
<li><i class="icon-ok PadRight5"></i>Nesting Lists</li>
</ul>

<p>You can practice Lists either with the Code Tester or by making a new file.
  If you do it the latter way, make sure to include in your file the DOCTYPE
Statement and the required tags you learned in Lesson 1. </p>


<p>And, as with all Lessons, there's a Lab. It's called &quot;First Lists.&quot; This
  time around, you'll be building on Lab 2's five files where you did
  some basic text markup. If you had any errors in those files, make sure you've made
  all the corrections before doing this Lab so you don't carry forward any goofs.
  Makes sense?</p>

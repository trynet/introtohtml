<h1 id="lead" class="page-header">Lesson 5: Links</h1>

    <p class="introduction lead">Since we're in a hypermedia environment, maybe it's time to reveal

          one of the greatest strengths of the Internet - the ability to easily move

          users from one document to another.</p>



<p>Of course, I'm talking about creating hyperlinks.</p>



        <p>We'll examine the five different ways to use the Anchor Tag, the tag
          needed 

          to move users up, down, sideways, and inside out around the web.</p>
<p id="learn">In this lesson you'll learn:</p>

<li><i class="icon-ok PadRight5"></i>How To Link To A Target On A Different Page</li>
<li><i class="icon-ok PadRight5"></i>How To Link To A Target on The Same Page</li>
<li><i class="icon-ok PadRight5"></i>How To Make An External Page Link</li>
<li><i class="icon-ok PadRight5"></i>How To Create An Email Link</li>
 <li><i class="icon-ok PadRight5"></i>About  Anchor Tag Attributes</li>
</ul>



        
<p>Something you will notice as you learn web site development, is that creating 
  web content is much like putting pieces of a puzzle together. Knowing where 
  folders and files are, and how to refer (link) to them, is just the start of 
  learning how to put your puzzle together.</p>
  
  <p>To that end, you'll want to read <a href="../appendix/D.html">Appendix D - Files And Folders
    - What's In A Name</a>? which
  is about as important an idea as anything you'll learn in our class. To make
  web pages and sites, you have to understand how to use and refer to URLs, Path
    Statements, Locations, Addresses. It's really all the same--it's where a
    file is located and how you refer to it.</p>

<h1><a name="top"></a>Lesson 5: Links</h1>

    <p class="introduction">Since we're in a hypermedia environment, maybe it's time to reveal

          one of the greatest strengths of the Internet - the ability to easily move

          users from one location to another.</p>



<p>Of course, I'm talking about creating hyperlinks.</p>



        <p>We'll examine the five different ways to use the Anchor Tag, the tag
          needed 

          to move users up, down, sideways, and inside out around the web.</p>
<p id="learn">In this lesson you'll learn about:</p>
		
				<ul id="hightlights">
<li>Link To Another Page</li>
<li>Link To A Target On A Different Page</li>
<li>Link To A Target on The Same Page</li>
<li>External Page Link</li>
<li>Email Link</li>
 <li>Anchor Tag Attributes</li>
</ul>



        
<p>Something you will notice as you learn web site development, is that creating 
  web content is much like putting pieces of a puzzle together. Knowing where 
  folders and files are, and how to refer (link) to them, is just the start of 
  learning how to put your puzzle together.</p>

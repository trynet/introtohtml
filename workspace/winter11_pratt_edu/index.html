<blockquote><em>"Nations are engaging in an eco-type of terrorism whereby they can alter the climate, set off earthquakes, volcanoes remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves. . . So there are plenty of ingenious minds out there that are at work finding ways in which they can wreak havoc upon other nations. . . It's real, and that's the reason why we have to intensify our efforts."</em>
</blockquote>

<p>--Secretary of Defense William Cohen in 1997</p>

<p>With the use of HAARP (High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program), contrails and/or chemtrails, and possibly the stimulation of our sun by outside civilizations, 
our weather patterns have changed drastically in the last decade and are likely to continue to change as man attempts to control nature with his sophisticated toys.</p>

<p>The High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) is supposedly an ionospheric research program jointly funded by the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, the University of Alaska, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).</p>

<p>HAARP can be a weapon of mass destruction. The radio waves it puts out are strong enough to cause earthquakes and are controlled by the U.S. military.</p>

<p>It is the largest ionospheric heater in the world. Capable of heating a 1000 square kilometer area of the ionosphere to over 50,000 degrees. It is also a phased array. Which means it is steer-able and those waves can be directed to a selected target area. The heating lifts the ionosphere in an area changing localized pressure systems jet stream route.</p> 

<p>Consequences of changing weather in one place can have a devastating downstream effect on weather in another place, i.e., an unusual amount of rain resulting in flooding in one place and/or severe droughts in another place; both events leading to the destruction of the food supply.</p>

<p>See images of weather changes possibly brought on by HAARP. Check out chemtrails. And take a look at our active sun.</p>

<p>Russia also has their version of HAARP, the Woodpecker, which gives off continuous bursts of sound like the woodpecker bird.</p>

<h3>What in the World Are They Spraying</h3>

<p>About a decade ago, the United States
created a thermal, anti-radiation barrier in a band of our atmosphere beneath the troposphere of the Earth.<br/>
It turns out to be a two-edged sword, though, as the aerosol spraying
will undeniably affect some individuals making them sick
and compromise their <strong>immune systems</strong>
and <strong>respiratory systems</strong>.<br/>
The trade off, supposedly, is long
term survival of our civilization.</p>

<p>The hypothesis has been put forth the Sun
is being stimulated by an outside civilization and we are trying to slow those climate altering effects on the Earth with this spraying.</p>

<p>Contrails or chemtrails are having an effect on our skies, our weather, and our climate and this is done by design.</p>

<p>The contrails are flown to map the sky of scalar/EM energy signatures and to
make what is invisible visible. This is one reason for the chemtrails!</p>

<h3>HAARP versus Russian Woodpecker</h3>

<p>Listen to the sound of the Woodpecker</p>



HAARP can be a weapon of mass destruction.

Radio Waves strong enough to cause earthquakes are controlled by the U.S. military.

It’s the largest ionospheric heater in the world. Capable of heating a 1000 square kilometer area of the ionosphere to over 50,000 degrees. It’s also a phased array. Which means it’s steer-able and those waves can be directed to a selected target area. The heating lifts the ionosphere in an area changing localized pressure systems jet stream route. 

Consequences of changing weather in one place can have a devastating downstream effect on weather in another place, i.e., an unusual amount of rain resulting in flooding in one place and/or severe droughts in another place; both events leading to the destruction of the food supply.

 
Reference to Barium in the HAARP patent report:

"It has also been proposed to release large clouds of barium in the magnetosphere so that photo ionization will increase the cold plasma density, thereby producing electron precipitation through enhanced whistler-mode interaction."

 

Bizarre Glowing Clouds 30 Min Before China Quake   Large aurora like clouds were filmed just before the Sichuan earthquake in China in the area of the epicenter of the quake. Some believe these strange clouds are caused by  manipulation of the ionosphere with HAARP.

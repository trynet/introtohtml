  <p>Work Space is your dedicated place to post your Lab  files for 
    me to review and make my comments. <a href="#notes">See detailed notes</a> 
    on using Work Space.</p>


  <!--#include virtual="../cgi-bin/ws1_incl_workspace.pl" -->

 <ol>
          <li>Wherever you are in this class when you select Work Space at the
             top or bottom of any page, you'll be coming this way. Work Space
            is set up exactly like computer files and folders are set up on most
            computers.. 
            <br />
            <br />
            On this page you will be uploading your .html files for me to review.</p>
You can only upload a file with a .html extension.   
            <p>  The
            images folder contains all the files you need for this class so there
            is nothing for you to upload there.<br />

          </li>

          <li>Uploading a file is simple and something you're familiar with.
            In 
            <strong>Step 1</strong>, select the Browse button and then navigate
             to the location of your file. For example, suppose you have a folder
             on your desktop called Labs (something you should do for your Lab
            files) with a file in it called index.html. Locate the Labs folder
            and then select index.html, choose Open, and away you go. Step 1
            is done. <br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>For <strong>Step 2</strong>, you must type in the filename that
             you chose in Step 1 (including the extension) which in our example
             would be "index.html" (without the quotation marks). Select the
             Upload File button. Do you see the filename which is hyper linked?
             You did it!!<br />
            <br />
            When you click on the filename link, a browser window will pop up 
            and you'll see your file. That's magic.<br />
            <br />
            As will be explained early and often, please save your creativity 
            when it comes to naming files. Use the filenames that I specify. <strong>Stick 
            with these rules:</strong> Filenames must be lowercase and without 
            any spacing between characters. Make sure to use file extensions, 
            e.g., .html, .gif, .css. You're not going very far without those principles, 
            trust me.<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>If you mess something up, don't worry because we have all kinds 
            of  built-in prompts to assist you with uploading and managing your 
            files.<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>To delete any file, just tap on the trash can icon <img src="../images/delete.gif" alt="Trash Can Icon" width="22" height="22" /> 
            preceding the filename, then follow the instructions.<br />
            <br />
          </li><li>Here are some other things to keep in mind:<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li style="display:inline;"> 
            <ul>
             
              <li>There is no way to delete folders, rename folders or make new 
                folders.</li>
              <li>There's no way to upload more than one file at a time.</li>

              <li><strong>If you upload a file with the exact same filename as
                  an existing file, you will be asked if you want to overwrite
                  the existing file. If so, the old file
                will be deleted automatically and replaced with your new 
one. This is exactly what you want to do as you move forward with each Lab!!</strong></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
      </ol>

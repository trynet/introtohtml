<h1>How Much?</h1>

<p>by Bud Kraus Published <span> August 13 </span></p>

</header>

<p>If you are new to gardening you are going to wonder, <strong>"how much should I water, how much should I fertilize"?</strong> The truth of the matter is I do it but experience and not by science but that can get me into trouble.</p>

<p>I like to think that i make gardens like the way my Grandmother cooked meals. <em>A pinch of this, a handful of that.</em> Cooking by feel worked for her and it has worked pretty well for me.</p>

<p> Speaking of fertilizer, I try to keep chemicals out of the garden but I am not a purist about this. Once I put way too much fertilizer around the tomato plants and I proved too much is no good either. The overdose resulted in plants that turned yellow and, grew tall and did not yield as many tomatoes as they should have.</p>

<h1>Something I'll Pay Attention To Next Year</h1>

<p>by Bud Kraus | Published <span> July 12 </span></p>

</header>

<p>One thing I've <strong><em>never paid any attention to is the pH factor</em></strong> of my soil. I know this is a measure of a soils acidity and that it has an effect on plants but I've never paid much attention to it since each year I feed my garden beds new soil and other goodies in  my <a href="prep.html#start"> preparation </a>.</p>

<p>Here is a table of pH factors I found that will help explain all of this doing some research for this article.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Denomination </th>
<th> pH range </th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr> 
<td> Ultra acid </td>
<td> 3.5 </td>
</tr>

<tr> 
<td> Extremely acid </td>
<td> 3.5-4.4 </td>
</tr>

<tr> 
<td> Very strongly acid </td>
<td> 4.5-5.0 </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> Strongly acid </td>
<td> 5.1-5.5 </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> Moderately acid </td>
<td> 5.6-6.0 </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> Slightly acid </td>
<td> 6.1-6.5 </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> Neutral </td>
<td> 6.6-7.3 </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> Slightly alkaline </td>
<td> 7.4-7.8 </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> Moderately alkaline </td>
<td> 7.9-8.4 </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> Strongly alkaline </td>
<td> 8.5-9.0 </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> Very Strongly alkaline </td>
<td> 9.0 </td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<tfoot>
<tr>
<td colspan="2"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_p"> Soil pH </a> </td>
</tr>
</tfoot>

</table>

<p>For best results, use a pH factor in the 6 - 7 range</p>

<h1>Keeping Out The Pests</h1>

<p>by Bud Kraus | Published <span> July 1 </span></p>

</header>

<p>No doubt, one of the biggest hassles I've had over the years is keeping out the animals that I don't want in my garden. Bunny rabbits, gophers and squirrels have not always understood that I don't labor for their benefit.  See More</p>

<h1>About My Blog</h1>

<p>Every once in awhile I feel like I have to write something about my garden.  When I do this is where I write it.  Maybe I'm frustrated with the lack of sun we've had recently or I'm not happy about a gopher we can't get rid of.</p>

<p>When it's time to rant or share I add something new here.</p>

<p>Hello World</p>

OK Great! Now I really want to learn how to get my own images onto this page. Additionally I need to know how to size them so they don't take forever to load and so they are pretty much the same size. This is a problem in my mind because they are all different dimensionallyin their original state. Remember we are talking about artwork here so all the images have to look really gooooooood and the same as they do in their original state.So how exactly would I go about putting images from my own files onto this notepad page?

 I had this idea to create my web pages as we go along with the lessons so it will actually get done in ten weeks.I am really hoping this can happen sooner than later because I would rather be spending my time with a brush -even though this is fun too.

There are many more questions in my head as to the "right way" to go about this, for example linking different pages,using all the crazy urls I bought as a deal from GoDaddy to send viewers to the different sections of my site,and the miriad of other little things that have held me back from accomplishing this task years ago.

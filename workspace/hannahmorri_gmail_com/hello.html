<p>I am an illustrator, artist and occasional designer. I make drawings, collages, and paintings; I also sew and use fabric. I make books, cartoons, book covers, and prints. I also have been known to make wonky, fun dolls. I like to upcycle, recycle, and reuse materials whenever possible.</p>

<p>I want my new website (updated!) to be clean, fresh, simple and current. It will feature an easy to view portfolio as well as snippets, musings and commentary, written, illustrated, and photographed (a blog/sketchpad, in other words.)

<h1>How Much?</h1>

<p>by Bud Kraus | Published August 13</p>

<p>If you are new to gardening you are going to wonder, <strong>"how much should I water, how much should I fertilize"?</strong> The truth of the matter is I do it but experience and not by science but that can get me into trouble.</p>

<p>I like to think that I make gardens like the way my Grandmother cooked meals.  <em>A pinch of this, a handful of that.</em> Cooking by feel worked for her and it has worked pretty well for me.</p>

<p>Speaking of fertilizer, I try to keep chemicals out of the garden but I am not a purist about this. Once I put way too much fertilizer around the tomato plants and I proved too much is no good either. The overdose resulted in plants that turned yellow and, grew tall and did not yield as many tomatoes as they should have.</p>

<h1>Something I'll Pay Attention To Next Year</h1>

<p>by Bud Kraus | Published July 12</p>

<p>One thing I've <strong><em>never paid any attention to is the pH factor</em></strong> of my soil. I know this is a measure of a soils acidity and that it has an effect on plants but I've never paid much attention to it since each year I feed my garden beds new soil and other goodies in <a href="prep.html#start">my preparation.</a></p>

<p>Here is a table of pH factors I found that will help explain all of this doing some research for this article.</p>

<table>
<thread>
<tr>
<th>Denomination</th>
<th>pH range</th>
</tr>
</thread>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Ultra acid</td>
<td>3.5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Extremely acid</td>
<td>3.5 - 4.4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Very strongly acid</td>
<td>4.5 - 5.0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Strongly acid</td>
<td>6.1 - 6.5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Neutral</td>
<td>6.6 - 7.3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Slightly Alkaline</td>
<td>7.4 - 7.8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Moderately alkaline</td>
<td>7.9 - 8.4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Strongly alkaline</td>
<td>8.5 - 9.0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Very strongly alkaline</td>
<td>9.0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
<tfoot>
<tr>
<td colspan="2">Source:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_p" </a> </td>
</tr>
</tfoot>
</table>

<p>For best results, use a pH factor in the 6 - 7 range</p>

<h1>Keeping Out The Pests</h1>

<p>by Bud Kraus | Published July 1</p>

<p>No doubt, one of the biggest hassles I've had over the years is keeping out the animals that I don't want in my garden.  Bunny rabbits, gophers and squirrels have not always understood that I don't labor for their benefit.  See More</p>

<h1>About My Blog</h1>

<p>Every once in awhile I feel like I have to write something about my garden.  When I do this is where I write it.  Maybe I'm frustrated with the lack of sun we've had recently or I'm not happy about a gopher we can't get rid of.</p>

<p>When it's time to rant or share I add something new here.</p>

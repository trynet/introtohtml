<h1>Planting The Garden</h1>

<section>

<p>For reasons unknown only to me, it's usually May 12 when most of the planting
  for the garden takes place. It all gets started with a trip to the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Centre-Ridge-Garden-Center/124525594281837?sk=wall">Center
  Ridge Nursery</a> in Nutley, NJ.</p>

<p>Here's my wife, Arlene, picking out a few things at the nursery.</p>

<p>We also pick up a few herbs because there is nothing like fresh herbs to spice
  up your life.</p>

<h2>What We Plant</h2>

<section>

 <p>Some herbs are perennials so we leave them in the ground (like chives)
  but most of these we just plant every year:</p>

<ul class="plant">
<li>parsley</li>
<li>basil</li>
<li>rosemary</li>
<li>thyme</li>
<li>steveeia<br />
(It's a sweet herb we like to put in our ice tea}</li>
</ul>

</section>

<section>

<p>We always plant these vegetables because most of them are not as good as they used to be when you buy them at the store.</p>

<ul>
<li>tomatoes
<ul>
<li>early girl</li>
<li>sweet 100 cherry</li>
<li>big boy</li>
</ul></li>
<li>zucchini or yellow squash</li>
<li>peppers
<ul>
<li>green</li>
<li>red</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

</section>

<section>

<p>But here is what we never get because they're either easy and cheap to buy at the store and they taste (sort of) like vegetables, take up too much space in the garden or the little critters eat them and I'm not much for growing the food other than for my family and friends. </p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<section>

<p>When I talk about "laying out the garden" before everything is planted it's
  just my way to organize what will go where. After all these years I know what
  plants, like tomatoes, need the most sunlight and which ones, like zucchinis,
  can stand the shade.</p>

<section id="bot" class="clearfix">
 
 <p>This gives you a rough idea where the plants go.  Give your plants as much space as you can.  Overcrowding will give you a very poor yield.  Roots need space to grow and so do the leafy parts of your plants.</p>

<h2>Sowing Seeds</h2>

<p>You'll love this video of Arlene, hard at work, sowing the breakfast radish
  seeds.</p>

<h2>In A Few Weeks</h2>

<section>

 <img src="images/cages.jpg"  alt="Photo Of Tomato Cages" /> 

<p>A few weeks after the tomato seedlings have been planted I put a cage around
  each plant so that it will grow into it. The cage is an excellent way to support
  the plant and the weight of the tomatoes that are about 7 weeks away from harvest.</p>

<li>Prepare the rows where the seeds (radishes, carrots and peas) will go.</li>
<li>Plant the seedlings and sow the seeds.</li>
<li>Add some fertilizer and water.</li>

<h1>Lesson 1: The Basics</h1>

<p class="introduction">In the beginning there was nothing. Then somewhere in the mid 1990s,

          we were given (who gave us is coming) the ability to separate structure

      from style in a web page.</p>

<p>Structure? In a web page? Like a building's structure? That is exactly what
  the sole purpose of HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language - is. HTML is a lot like
  grammar because it is used by web designers, authors, and developers as the
   way to give meaning to content.</p>
  
<p>Chances are, you haven't a clue as to what I am talking about - but
    you  will - as we proceed with learning HTML.</p>

<p>Are you with me? Don't worry if you're not because you soon will be.  I will
  teach you lots of things and let you try a few things in your Lab work.</p>

<p>I'll be mentioning Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) in this class, but we won't
  really get to work with it. Why? Our focus here is on what you have to master
   first before you can think about style and page layout. This class deals
  with web page structure which is the only purpose of HTML.</p>

<p> CSS is a rather large and complicated subject. It would make no sense to
  jump into it  unless you get the HTML part of this web page making business
  down first.</p>

<p>So let's take it easy at the start and get first things first out of the way by learning what tags we must have in an HTML file.
</p>


<p id="learn">In this lesson you'll learn:</p>

<ul id="highlights">
     <li>What Is HTML?</li>
     <li>How To Start An HTML Document (web page)</li>
     <li>What The DOCTYPE Statement Is</li>
     <li>What The Required Tags Are</li>
     <li>HTML Syntax</li>
     <li>Conventions Used For This Class</li>
</ul>
<p>As with all Lessons, Lesson 1 has a Lab. It's an Ice Breaker for the class
  and it's called &quot;Hello World.&quot; That's your main assignment as you
  begin to learn HTML.</p>

<p>Hi <?php echo $firstname ?>!! I'm really glad to see you're going to learn HTML. 
Just start with Lesson 1 and work your way through the class. I'm here to help and you'll see I'm pretty speedy with an email reply.</p>

<p>You shouldn't see anything about making payment but if you do just ignore it because I know you've paid already.</p>

<p>Since this is your first time here drop by my <a href="/frontoffice/">Front Office</a> for more info about this class.</p>

<p class="center">Have Fun!!</p>

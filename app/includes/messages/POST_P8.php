<p>You've made it thus bar <?php echo $firstname ?> and I think you've learned a ton. This lesson shows you some of the new HTML 5 tags and how they are used to describe content.</p>

<p>When you're done and in Lesson 10you'll get a look at Cascading Style Sheets, a bit about how it works and how I applied it to In My Garden. I suggest that you learn CSS. It's more complicated than HTML but I think it's really cool because there's so much you can do with it. It's the language of web design style for browsers, tablets, smart phone, the printer and every kind of media now in existence or yet to be.</p>

<p>I teach CSS online in <a href="frontoffice/learning_css.html">Practical CSS</p> which I hope you'll be moving on to do or you can catch me live in a New York class room teaching it too.</p>

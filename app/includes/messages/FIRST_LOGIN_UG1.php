<p>Hi <?php echo $firstname ?>!! I'm really glad to see you're going to learn HTML. The first two lessons and labs are free so you'll get a chance to see how this works. 
Just start with Lesson 1 and work your way through the class. I'm here to help and you'll see I'm pretty speedy with an email reply.</p>

<!-- <p>To move on to Lesson 3 your investment to learn HTML  with me is $250. But there's no need to think about that now.</p> -->

<p>Since this is your first time here drop by my <a href="/frontoffice/">Front Office</a> for more info about this class.</p>

<p class="center">Have Fun!!</p>

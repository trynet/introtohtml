<p>Hi <?php echo $firstname ?>!! I'm really glad to see you're going to learn more HTML. Just continue on with Lesson 7 which picks up just from where we left off in the FIT class. </p>

<p>You shouldn't see anything about making payment but if you do just ignore it because I know you've paid already.</p>

<p>Even though you pretty much know how this is going to work your ought to drop by my <a href="/frontoffice/">Front Office</a> for more info about this class.</p>

<p class="center">Have Fun!!</p>

Hi again, $firstname.

I see that you're feeling pretty confident about things and have moved on to the next Lesson. That's great because that is where things get a tad more interesting.
 
I'm about to show you the real basic HTML tags that you will use for so many web pages. As you'll see you are going to get started with the 5 .html files that make up the In My Garden project.  You'll continue to work on these 5 pages as you go on through the class and really learn HTML.

You do like home grown tomatoes, don't you?

Don't skip a page. Do everything in order for best results.

After you upload your pages you'll see you have a few options but I don't want to get ahead of myself.

See you in 2!!

Hi $firstname.

Thanks for making payment and continuing on with the FIT class.

I'm really excited to see that you're going to be learning more HTML with me. You'll see that the extension picks up from where we left off in Lesson 6.

After you finish a lab and when you upload your files you'll see that you have two choices:

1. Go on to the next Lesson and Lab without waiting for my review of your files.

OR

2. Wait for my review that I do within 48 hours.

You set the schedule. Take as long as you need to complete the course.

As always, remember to validate your pages and if you need to, look at the source code of my Sneak A Peek pages.

Have fun!!

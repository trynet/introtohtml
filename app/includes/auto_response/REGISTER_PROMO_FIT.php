Hi $firstname.

Thanks for continuing on with Intro To HTML which I also call the Joy Of Code Extension.

I'm really excited to see that you're going on with learning more HTML with me!

And since you've already paid you'll see that Lesson and Lab 7 is ready for you to complete so just get started. You'll see that this works a lot like the FIT class. 

When you need to log back into the class just go to http://www.joyofcode.com/sign-in. Your user id is your email address and I hope you remembered your password.

Oh yeah, is it ok if I add your name to the subscribers of my Joy Of Code blog where I write about - what else? - HTML, CSS and WordPress. 

Let me know if I can help you in any way. I am here to make this an enJoyable learning experience for you like I have for lots of people.

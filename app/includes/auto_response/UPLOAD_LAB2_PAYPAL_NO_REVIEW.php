Hi $firstname.

So, let me thank you for moving on with Intro To HTML. You're payment has been received and it's much appreciated.

With two Lessons and Labs under your belt you know the drill. After you upload your files for any lab you can:

1. Move on to the next Lesson without my review.

OR

2.  Wait to hear from me within 48 hours after I review your pages.

As always, if you have questions, email is the way to reach me.

Keep doing everything in order. Do not skip over anything as you go on to learn HTML!! 

See you in 3.

Hi $firstname.

With two Lessons and Labs under your belt you know the drill. After you upload your files for any lab you can:

1. Move on to the next Lesson without my review.

OR

2.  Wait to hear from me within 48 hours after I review your pages.

As always, if you have questions, email is the way to reach me.

But I see that you want me to look at your fancy Lab 2 pages and that will be my pleasure. Please  hold on while I take a look before you go on to Lesson 3.

Keep doing everything in order. Do not skip over anything as you go on to learn HTML!!

See you in 3.

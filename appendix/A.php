<h1>Appendix A: Resources</h1>

<p>Admittedly, you probably won't appreciate most of these resources, especially
  as you get started, but that's ok. I used a lot of these links to help me create
  this class. True, I knew a lot of the material before I ever started but I
  sure don't know it all. As I made this class, I found a few good links I had
  to share with you, and if you find something you like let me know and I'll add
  it to this list.</p>
  

  
  <ul class="nav">
    <li><a href="http://joshduck.com/periodic-table.html">Periodic Table of the Elements</a>
      Great way of seeing all the elements in a chart that should look familiar.</li>
    
    <li><a href="http://www.thesitewizard.com/webdesign/htmlvalidation.shtml">HTML
      And CSS Validation: Should You Validate Your Web Page?</a>
      A good article on HTML (and CSS) Validation.</li>
    
    <li><a href="http://diveintohtml5.info/">Diving Into HTML5</a>
      One of the key resources I used for this class and  a big help as I transitioned from XHTML.</li>
    
    <li><a href="http://diveintohtml5.info/forms.html">A Form Of Madness</a>
From the above tome, a great explanation of all the great gewgaws of HTML5 forms.
    </li>
    
    <li><a href="http://html5doctor.com/element-index/#">An A - Z Index Of HTML5 Elements</a>
      Short and slightly geeky - but very useful - descriptions of new and re-defined
      HTML5 elements.</li>
  </ul>

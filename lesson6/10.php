 <h1>Lesson 6: Images And Videos</h1>




<p class="introduction">Can you imagine this virtual world without imagery? A world of text 

          alone as it once was (and a few still think it should be - but that
  discussion is for another 

          day).</p>

        <p>The reason we embed images  (insert images within a web page), 

          or use them for background, is not just to make our pages look pretty.
          More about how images are used in web page design later in this lesson.</p>

        
<p>In this lesson, you won't learn how to make or optimize imagery for the web.
  Nor will I cover topics like art direction, color theory and management, and
  the like. Learning graphical design and production is a discipline unto
  itself and is not directly related to HTML.</p>

        <p>Rather, the approach here is to introduce you to working with simple
          

          .gif and .jpg files for your web pages. </p>
        <p>I'll also show you just how easy it is to embed a video into a web
          page.</p>

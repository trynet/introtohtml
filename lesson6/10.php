<p class="introduction lead">Can you imagine this virtual world without imagery? A world of text 

          alone as it once was (and a few still night think it should be - but that
  discussion is for another 

          day).</p>

        <p>The reason we embed images  (insert images within a web page), 

          or use them for background, is not just to make our pages look pretty.
          More about how images are used in web page design later in this lesson.</p>

        
<p>In this lesson, you won't learn how to make or optimize imagery for the web.
  Nor will I cover topics like art direction, color theory and management, and
  the like. Learning graphical design and production is a discipline unto
  itself and is not  related to HTML.</p>

        <p>Rather, the approach here is to introduce you to working with simple
          

          .gif and .jpg files for your web pages.        </p>
        <p>I'll also show you just how easy it is to embed a video into a web
          page.</p>

            <li><i class="icon-ok PadRight5"></i>Web Image Formats</li>
            <li><i class="icon-ok PadRight5"></i>How Images Are Used In Web Design</li>

            <li><i class="icon-ok PadRight5"></i>The img Tag</li>

            <li><i class="icon-ok PadRight5"></i>Clickable Images</li>
            <li><i class="icon-ok PadRight5"></i>What Ever Happened To...?</li>
            <li><i class="icon-ok PadRight5"></i>Embedding Videos</li>

          </ul>
          
          
          <p>In Lab 6 - First Embeds, you'll be transforming your five .html files to
  accept  embedded images. You can download all the images you will need for
  this Lab right from the Lab itself. I've also put all the images in your work
  space to save you from having to upload the images yourself.</p>
<p>Images are normally kept in a sub-folder relative to your .html files. You'll
   see more about that when you read through Lesson 6 - Images And Videos , and
  when you do the Lab and post your work to your Work Space.</p>

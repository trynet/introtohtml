 <p>Greetings and welcome to the Joy Of Code: Intro To HTML.</p>
<p>Each weekiversary start here and see what's going on for the new week. I'll 
  be giving you an overview of what you can expect to learn and do during the 
  week.</p>
<p>Weekiversary? The day of the week that you first logged on to the class. 
  Of course, if you Change Your Schedule that day will change so just remember
   that when you start a new Chapter and Lab come here first to check announcements.</p>
<p>I'll use email, too, but this is my place to post general information notices. 
  (Oh, this is fun. I get to do all the talking - for now).</p>
<p>This week I want you to click through everything and get comfortable with
  how Intro To HTML is organized. And please introduce yourself to me. Please
   be sure to <a href="say_hello.html">Say
   Hello</a>!!</p>
<p>In addition to reading Lesson 1 - The Basics and giving the Code Tester a
   ride, please read everything in the Front Office, which is where you are now. 
</p>
<p>You'll also get your first chance to use the Work Space when you do Lab 1 - 
  Hello World. It's just a simple web page file that'll give you a chance to test 
  things out before we get into the good stuff starting next week.</p>
<p>To do the Labs you'll have to multi-task, that is, work with two applications 
  at the same time. (Have faith, you can do it!!)</p>
<p>If you know how to work with two applications sharing the same file, you're 
  ahead of the game, but if you don't know how, you're going to learn this now. 
  Multi-tasking is one of the key powers of computing life and it is a skill that 
  you'll find useful in many computing endeavors.</p>
<p>If you don't know how to multi-task, read my <a href="appendix/a.html">Appendix 
  A - Multi-tasking a/k/a Doing The Application Shuffle</a>. It is a step by step 
  tutorial and, as I've said, multi-tasking is required for you to do the Lab 
  and to get ready to fly.</p>
<p>Are you ready? <a href="../../lesson1/10.html">Lesson 1</a> is waiting.</p>
